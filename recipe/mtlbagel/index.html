<p>My roommate Alexis and I have always been hardcore fans of Montreal-style Bagels.</p>
<p>Alexis grew up in Bromont, which is just a little over an hour&rsquo;s drive from Montreal. Lucky for him, he has had plenty of occasions indulging these sacred rings. My relationship with these bagels however, is somewhat different. Never having lived in Montreal (though I hope this will change soon), every occasion to lay my hands on these bagels was like striking gold on <a href="https://classicreload.com/win3x-the-yukon-trail.html">The Yukon Trail</a>.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to Montreal Bagels when visiting my close friend Wilson, who was then studying for his Masters at McGill. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate it. All I knew was that it was fresh and tasted better than what you&rsquo;d get in a supermarket. Luckily, my palate had improved to appreciate them more every time Wilson brought some to visit me when I lived in Toronto. I noticed how sweet they were from the honey in the dough. I noticed the rings were thinner and the bread was denser. I noticed how they were so flavour packed; one could argue you merely need to toast it a little before indulging. But most of all, I noticed I was hooked. I was so hooked that I made sure I can get them whenever the opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p>Years later, on a trip to visit my family in Boston, I got to set foot in Montreal for a layover. With the mere 90 minutes I had, I walked to Fairmount Bagels before hurrying back to the bus terminal. During the ride, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that people were reacting negatively to the pungent smell of my bagels. Despite that, I refused to shut the bag. Everytime I inhaled, I felt a high from the satisfaction that I had my hands on them once again. I was fairly sure that nobody on that trip appreciated it, including the border agent when he asked if I had anything to declare. I slammed the dozen and a half of everything bagels on the counter. He showed a brief interest in the bag, clearly because of the smell, but did not investigate further. I almost felt offended that he didn&rsquo;t ask what was in the bag, for I was ready to give him a lecture on why he would even question these obviously-more-superior-than-NY-bagels bagels. Hit me with a ten year ban, America, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re missing.</p>
<p>Ever since I moved down to sunny California, getting Montreal Bagels is obviously more difficult. Local wood-fire oven bagels weren&rsquo;t close enough to the real deal. Over a year after I&rsquo;ve moved down here, my kickass work aunt Michelle mentioned that she was going to visit Montreal one day. I begged her to get some Montreal Bagels for me, to which she gladly brought six back for me. Boy, did I cherish them.</p>
<p>NOT.</p>
<p>I let them fucking mold, thinking it was the eighth deadly sin to freeze them. I was using a knife, two in the morning, to cut off any remaining pieces from all six bagels and munching on it, hoping that I wouldn&rsquo;t die from the mold. Even if I did, that&rsquo;s rightfully the eighth sin I deserved.</p>
<p>As I wept over my mistake in the later months, the stars in the galaxy of honey rings aligned. I acquired a standup mixer, making my dough game stronger. Alexis moved in earlier this year, becoming the second pair of hands to push this to happen. Now, we&rsquo;re stuck at home because of the shelter-in-place order. No better time to make our own Montreal Bagels.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-dont-fuck-with-intros-read-this-instead">If you don&rsquo;t fuck with intros, read this instead</h2>
<p>This is our interpretation of a Montreal Bagel: lightly caramelized crust, not much crispier nor chewier than what&rsquo;s inside. As you take a bite, you feel the texture of the sesame or whatever toppings are on the bagel, but what comes first is the sweet, sweet taste of honey bursting in your mouth. You&rsquo;ll likely notice that it takes a bit more to chew than their less superior counterparts. As you figure that out, the sesame finally catches up to the roaring honey taste, and what you get is the harmony between sweet and savoury.</p>
<p>My favourite flavours are everything and sesame, from Fairmount and St Viateur, respectively. They&rsquo;re the two pillars of Montreal Bagels. The bagels are great on their own, perhaps with a bit of butter or cream cheese. Dairy fat really makes them shine. Make a sandwich if you do so desire but don&rsquo;t complain when all your ingredients fall out of the huge hole.</p>
<p>Last time we made it, Alexis and I were able to churn out 3 dozen bagels in 3 hours. For us, the bottleneck was the size of our oven which only bakes up to 9 at a time. I&rsquo;ve added a few tips here and there in the recipe, so hopefully it&rsquo;ll help you make yours efficiently too.</p>
<p>All of y&rsquo;all were asking for the recipe, so here it is.</p>
<p>Last bit of housekeeping items: this is not our final final recipe, so don&rsquo;t break up with your significant other over who read it correctly. Chances are you were both wrong, because we were wrong and updated the recipe. That, and we&rsquo;ll add fancy pictures and graphs and illustrations, so if you&rsquo;d like SOME FREE EXPOSURE (or free bagels) hit us up :)</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Read all the steps first before you try anything. Our humble experience is that the timing between the dough being rolled, kneaded, turned into rings, and rested plays a big role in the texture of the bagel, so no time for you to read the recipe and miss out on timing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take your eggs out in advanced so that they&rsquo;re room temperature, check notes below on how to quickly warm them up if you forgot to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix Wet Ingredients A together and let yeast activate. Mix Wet Ingreidents B, adding salt last. Mix B and A together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add wet ingredients to the bread flour, mix well and knead 8 - 10 minutes. The dough should ideally be smooth and supple. If you&rsquo;re using a dough hook, the dough should shrink when you turn the mixer off. Expect the dough to be sticky, so use a bit of oil or flour on your hands. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover with wrap and let rest for 60 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the rest time comes close to the hour, preheat the oven to 440F(225C). If you have a pizza stone, remember to preheat it in the oven too. If you don&rsquo;t have a stone, preheat the baking sheet instead. Mix and heat the honey water to a boil, then simmer until it&rsquo;s needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightly flour and pour the dough onto the working surface. Lightly dust your hands before working the dough. Cut your dough into 5cm/2inch strips. Do yourself a favour and only cut the strip you will be working on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roll one end of the strip to a 20cm(8in), 2cm(3/4in) wide dough. Dust your hand with flour again. With your palm facing up, hold the dough with your purlicue (the space between your index finger and thumb, yes) and flip your hand over. With your thumb, break off the dough where you&rsquo;ve stopped stretching the strip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the top of your palm, roll the two tips of the dough together. If you dusted enough flour on your hand, then the ring won&rsquo;t stick on your hand. Only roll as many as you can fit in one batch in the oven</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just watch this damn video, timestamped at 2:03 - <a href="https://youtu.be/kFAGV35eu6I?t=123">https://youtu.be/kFAGV35eu6I?t=123</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if it shrinks. Let rest for 5 minutes, the dough would be rested enough for you to do some cosmetic repairs (stetch it out evenly, reroll the two tips together, fix the shape, etc), the let it rest for another 5-10. Bring the Honey Water back to a boil, and cut parchment paper the same size as your pizza stone or baking sheet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One at a time, put three to four rings into the boiling Honey Water. I&rsquo;d recommend you use a spatula to push water underneathe the rings. Make sure the ring is not sticking to the pot before you chuck in the next one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rings should float in the water not too long after it&rsquo;s in the water. Flip the ring 1 minute after it&rsquo;s been in the water, and let boil for another 1 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the splotted spatula, one by one dunk the boiled rings into a bowl of sesame. Don&rsquo;t use a plate for your sesame, as told by my work aunt. If you&rsquo;re an idiot us like and don&rsquo;t know how to portion control, sprinkling it works. Make sure you sesame&rsquo;d both sides, and transfer them onto your parchment paper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve boiled and sesame&rsquo;d the batch, slide the loaded parchment paper on the stone/sheet. We do it by putting parchement paper on a cutting board while we load them, and pull the parchment paper onto our pizza stone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bake between 14-16 minute, maybe 20 minutes if you&rsquo;re using a baking sheet? Honestly I don&rsquo;t know. Google &ldquo;St Viateur Bagels&rdquo; and look at how brown theirs is, and pull your bagels out when it&rsquo;s just before the colour you googled. While you bake, start rolling the next batch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let them fucking rest. Best tasting bagels aren&rsquo;t the fresh ones straight out the oven, but the ones that sat around for a bit. Eat the first batch when you&rsquo;re done rolling the third. Shit&rsquo;s going to be straight fire</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you forgot to take our your eggs ahead of time, just soak them in lukewarm water for 10 minutes before using them</li>
<li>Honey crystalizes sometimes, and the way to make them smooth is to heat the container in warm water. As honey warms up, the crystals disappear. I mean, microwave works too but, last time we used it, the honey was warm enough to over excite the yeast and it messed up our consistency</li>
<li>If your bagels come out too light, try adding more honey to your boiling water. We like to have just enough water such that it&rsquo;ll float properly, and add a somewhat generous amount of honey</li>
</ul>
