    <p>My roommate Alexis and I have always been a hardcore fan of Montreal-style Bagels.  Alexis grew up within reasonable driving distance from Montreal, so he has had plenty occasions with the sacred rings.</p>
    <p>I was first introduced to Montreal Bagels when visiting my close friend Wilson, who was then studying for his Masters at McGill. Years later, I used the hour and a half layover I had to walk to Fairmount Bagels before running back to the bus terminal, departing for Boston to see my sister. The border agent did not question my two dozens of everything bagel. Last year I was also blessed by my work aunt Michelle with sesame bagels from St Viateur.</p>
    <p>Unlike New York style bagels, Montreal Bagels are much sweeter, noticably more dense, the rings thinner and the holes larger. My favourate flavours are Everything bagels from Fairmount, and Sesame bagels from St Viateur. They&#39;re great on their own, perhaps with a bit of butter or cream cheese. Diary fat really makes these bagels shine. Make a sandwhich if you do so desire, but don&#39;t complain when all your ingredients fall out of the huge hole.</p>
    <p>All of y&#39;all were asking for the recipe, so here it is. Last week, Alexis and I were able to churn 3 dozens worth of bagels in 3 hours. For us, the bottleneck was the size of our oven, baking up to 9 at a time. I&#39;ve added a few tips here and there in the recipe, so hopefully it&#39;ll help you make yours efficiently too.</p>
    <p>Last bit of housekeeping items, this is not our final final recipe, so don&#39;t break up with your significant other over who saw it right. Chance are you were both wrong, because we were wrong and updated the recipe. That, and we&#39;ll add fancy pictures and graphs and illustrations, so if you&#39;d like SOME FREE EXPOSURE (or free bagels) hit us up :)</p>

  <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
  <p>Read all the steps first before you try anything. Our humble experience is that the timing between the dough being rolled, kneaded, turned into rings, and rested plays a big role in the texture of the bagel, so no time for you to read the recipe and miss out on timing.</p>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Mix Wet Ingredients A together and let yeast activate. Mix Wet Ingreidents B, adding salt last. Mix B into A</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Add wet ingredients to the bread flour, mix well and knead 6 - 8 minutes. The dough should ideally be smooth and supple. If you&#39;re using a dough hook, the dough should shrink when you turn the mixer off. Expect the dough to be sticky, so use a bit of oil or flour on your hands. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover with wrap and let rest for 60 minutes</p>
  </li>
    <li><p>As the rest time comes close to the hour, preheat the oven to 440F(225C). If you have a pizza stone, remember to preheat it in the oven too. If you don&#39;t have a stone, preheat the baking sheet instead. Mix and heat the honey water to a boil, then simmer until it&#39;s needed</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Lightly flour the surface and pour the dough onto a working surface. Lightly dust your hands before working the dough. Cut your dough into 5cm/2inch strips. Do yourself a favour and only cut the strip you will be working on</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Roll one end of the strip to a 20cm(8in), 2cm(3/4in) wide dough. Dust your hand with flour again. With your palm facing up, hold the dough with your purlicue (the space between your index finger and thumb, yes) and flip your hand over. With your thumb, break off the dough where you&#39;ve stopped stretching the strip, and with the top of your palm, roll the two tips of the dough together. If you dusted enough flour on your hand, then the ring won&#39;t stick on your hand. Only roll as many as you can fit in one batch in the oven</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Just watch this damn video, timestamped at 2:03 - <a href="https://youtu.be/kFAGV35eu6I?t=123">https://youtu.be/kFAGV35eu6I?t=123</a></p>
  </li>
    <li><p>Don&#39;t worry if it shrinks. Let rest for 5 minutes, the dough would be rested enough for you to do some cosmetic repairs (stetch it out evenly, reroll the two tips together, fix the shape, etc), the let it rest for another 5-10. Bring the Honey Water back to a boil, and cut parchment paper the same size as your pizza stone or baking sheet</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>One at a time, put three to four rings into the boiling Honey Water. I&#39;d recommend you use a spatula to push water underneathe the rings. Make sure the ring is not sticking to the pot before you chuck in the next one</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The rings should float in the water not too long after it&#39;s in the water. Flip the ring 1 minute after it&#39;s been in the water, and let boil for another 1 minutes</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Using the splotted spatula, one by one dunk the boiled rings into a bowl of sesame. Don&#39;t use a plate for your sesame, as told by my work aunt. If you&#39;re an idiot us like and don&#39;t know how to portion control, sprinkling it works. Make sure you sesame&#39;d both sides, and transfer them onto your parchment paper</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Once you&#39;ve boiled and sesame&#39;d the batch, slide the loaded parchment paper on the stone/sheet. We do it by putting parchement paper on a cutting board while we load them, and pull the parchment paper onto our pizza stone</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Bake between 14-16 minute, maybe 20 minutes if you&#39;re using a baking sheet? Honestly I don&#39;t know. Google &quot;St Viateur Bagels&quot; and look at how brown theirs is, and pull your bagels out when it&#39;s just before the colour you googled. While you bake, start rolling the next batch</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Let them fucking rest. Best tasting bagels aren&#39;t the fresh ones straight out the oven, but the ones that sat around for a bit. Eat the first batch when you&#39;re done rolling the third. Shit&#39;s going to straight fire</p>
    </li>
