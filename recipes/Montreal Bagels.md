# Montreal bagels

My roommate Alexis and I have always been a hardcore fan of Montreal-style Bagels.

Alexis grew up in Bromont, which is just a little over an hour's drive from Montreal. Lucky for him, he has had plenty of occasions indulging these sacred rings. My relationship with these bagels however, is somewhat different. Never having lived in Montreal (though I hope this will change soon), every single time I get to lay my hands on these it was as if I struck gold on Yukon Trail.

I was first introduced to Montreal Bagels when visiting my close friend Wilson, who was then studying for his Masters at McGill. Frankly, I didn't really appreciate it then, all I knew was that it was fresh and tasted better than what you'd get in a supermarket. Luckily, as Wilson brings them back to Toronto each time, my palatte has improved to appreicate them more. I noticed how sweet they were from the honey in the dough. I noticed the rings were thinner and the bread was denser. I noticed how they were so flavour packed with or without toppings one could argue you merely need to toast it a little before indulging. But most of all, I noticed I was hooked. I was so hooked that I made sure I can get them whenever the opportunity presents itself.

Years later, I got to set foot in Montreal during a layover to Boston, visiting my family. With the mere 90 minutes I had, I walked to Fairmount Bagels before having to run back to the bus terminal. Those bagels so pungent I almost suffocated from the winds of flavour on the red-eye greyhound ride. Desipte then, I refused to shut the bag. I'm fairly sure the nobody appreicated that, including the border agent when I slammed the dozen and a half of everything bagels on the counter when he asked if I had anything to declare. I almost felt offended that he didn't ask what was in the bag, for I was ready to give him a lecture on why he would even question these obviously-more-superior-than-ny-bagels bagels. Hit me with a 10 year ban America, you don't know what you're missing.

Ever since I moved down to sunny California, getting Montreal Bagels is obviously more spare and sparse. Local stone oven bagels weren't close enough to the real deal. Luckily my kickass work aunt Michelle visited Montreal and brought back six of them for me. I cherished them, NOT. I let them fucking mold, thinking it was the eighth deadly sin to freeze them. I was using a knife, two in the morning, to cut off any remaining pieces from all six bagels and munching on it, hoping that I won't die from the mold, and even if I did that's rightfully the eighth sin that I deserved.

As I wept over my mistake in the later months, the stars aligned. I was able to acquire a 5qt stand mixer, Alexis moved in, and we're stuck in our house because of the shelter-in-place. No better time to make our own bagels.

This is our interpretation a Montreal Bagel: lightly caramelized crust, not much crispier nor chewier than what's inside. As you take a bite, you feel the texture of the sesame or whatever toppings are on the bagel, but what comes first is the sweet, sweet taste of honey bursting in your mouth. You'll likely notice that it takes a bit more to chew than their less superior counterparts. As you figure that out, the sesame finally catches up to the roaring honey in taste, and what you get is the harmony between sweet and savory.

My favourate flavours are everything and sesame, from Fairmount and St Viateur, respectively. They're the two pillars of Montreal Bagels. The bagels are great on their own, perhaps with a bit of butter or cream cheese. Diary fat really makes them shine. Make a sandwhich if you do so desire, but don't complain when all your ingredients fall out of the huge hole.

Last time we made it, Alexis and I were able to churn 3 dozens worth of bagels in 3 hours. For us, the bottleneck was the size of our oven, baking up to 9 at a time. I've added a few tips here and there in the recipe, so hopefully it'll help you make yours efficiently too.

 All of y'all were asking for the recipe, so here it is.

Last bit of housekeeping items, this is not our final final recipe, so don't break up with your significant other over who saw it right. Chance are you were both wrong, because we were wrong and updated the recipe. That, and we'll add fancy pictures and graphs and illustrations, so if you'd like SOME FREE EXPOSURE (or free bagels) hit us up :)

## Steps
Read all the steps first before you try anything. Our humble experience is that the timing between the dough being rolled, kneaded, turned into rings, and rested plays a big role in the texture of the bagel, so no time for you to read the recipe and miss out on timing.

1. Mix Wet Ingredients A together and let yeast activate. Mix Wet Ingreidents B, adding salt last. Mix the two Wet Ingredients together

1. Combine wet ingredients with bread flour, mix well and knead. The dough should ideally be smooth and supple. If you're using a dough hook, the dough should shrink when you turn the mixer off. It was about 6-8 minutes on the mixer, so you'll probably need to  double the time kneading by hand

1. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover with wrap and let rest for 60 minutes. Expect the dough to be sticky, so use a bit of oil or flour on your hands

1. As the rest time comes close to the hour, preheat the oven to 440F(225C). If you have a pizza stone, remember to preheat it in the oven too. If you don't have a stone, preheat the baking sheet instead. Mix and heat the honey water to a boil, then simmer until it's needed

1. Lightly flour the surface and pour the dough onto the surface. Lightly dust your hands before working the dough. Cut your dough into 5cm/2inch strips. Do yourself a favour and only cut the strip you will be working on

1. Roll one end of the strip to a 20cm(8in), 2cm(3/4in) wide dough. Dust your hand with flour again. With your palm facing up, hold the dough with your purlicue (the space between your index finger and thumb, yes) and flip your hand over. With your thumb, break off the dough where you've stopped stretching the strip, and with the top of your palm, roll the two tips of the dough together. If you dusted enough flour on your hand, then the ring won't stick on your hand. Only roll as many as you can fit in one batch in the oven

1. Actually, just watch this damn video, timestamped at 2:03 - [https://youtu.be/kFAGV35eu6I?t=123](https://youtu.be/kFAGV35eu6I?t=123)

1. Don't worry if it shrinks. Let rest for 5 minutes, the dough would be rested enough for you to do some cosmetic repairs (stetch it out evenly, reroll the two tips together, fix the shape, etc), then let it rest for another 5-10. Bring the Honey Water back to a boil, and cut parchment paper the same size as your pizza stone or baking sheet

1. One at a time, put three to four rings into the boiling Honey Water. I'd recommend you use a spatula to push water underneathe the rings. Make sure the ring is not sticking to the pot before you chuck in the next one

1. The rings should float in the water not too long after it's in the water. Flip the ring 1 minute after it's been in the water, and let boil for another 1 minutes

1. Using the splotted spatula, one by one dunk the boiled rings into a bowl of sesame. Don't use a plate for your sesame, as told by my work aunt, and she's right. If you're an idiot like us and don't know how to portion control, sprinkling works. Make sure you sesame'd both sides, and transfer them onto your parchment paper

1. Once you've boiled and sesame'd the batch, slide the loaded parchment paper on the stone/sheet. We do it by putting parchement paper on a cutting board while we load them, and pull the parchment paper onto our pizza stone

1. Bake between 14-16 minute, maybe 20 minutes if you're using a baking sheet? Honestly I don't know. Google "St Viateur Bagels" and look at how brown theirs is, and pull your bagels out when it's just before the colour you googled. While you bake, start rolling the next batch

1. Let them fucking rest after it comes out. Best tasting bagels aren't the fresh ones straight out the oven, but the ones that sat around for a bit. Eat the first batch when you're done rolling the third. Shit's going to straight fire

## Notes
- If you forgot to take out your eggs ahead of time, just soak them in lukewarm water for 10 minutes before using them
